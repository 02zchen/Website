          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px"><i>Unix in a Nutshell</i> by Daniel Gilly and O’Reilly & Associates Inc. is a Unix reference manual for desktop users, specifically regarding System V and Solaris 2.0. The book, however, includes commands and information regarding many Unix systems on different platforms. <i>Unix in a Nutshell</i> is designed to be used by programmers and casual desktop users alike, containing both simple Unix commands and syntax, all the way to software development and programming. Despite its origins as a language meant for programmers and developers, varieties of Unix, such as the macOS, have become some of the most popular operating systems in the world. Understanding Unix is important for people today in order to understand the roots of some of the most popular operating systems, and even use the Unix shells in operating systems like macOS and Linux. This book can help people understand the underlying concepts of the original operating system macOS and Linux were based on. Understanding the foundations of modern operating systems is crucial to being able to troubleshoot and problem solve when faced with an unfamiliar challenge in a computer setting. <i>Unix in a Nutshell</i> could also be a good starting place for new programmers, as it has an entire section on programming with Unix and the syntax it uses. Unix is a foundational operating system to Linux as well, which is very popular in the cybersecurity world. Though most computers no longer run an unmodified version of Unix, the fundamentals of the operating system are still relevant to modern day programmers. Without Unix, we may never have seen Linux or macOS in our modern day computers, which would have drastically impacted the development of our modern operating systems and software.</h5>
