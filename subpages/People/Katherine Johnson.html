          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Katherine Johnson lives today as one of the brightest minds in the last century. She played a major role during a time where tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union were are their highest: the race to put a man in space. Colloquially known as the “Space Race”, this event springboarded Katherine Johnson into stardom as one of the most intelligent African American women (and one of the most intelligent people) at NASA at the time. </h5>

          <h1>Early Life and Education</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Katherine Johnson was born on August 26, 1918, in rural White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. Despite being the youngest of four, she quickly stood out to her parents with her prowess for math and intelligence. She graduated high school at the age of 14 - a feat considering most West Virginian schools did not allow African American students an education past eighth grade - and enrolled at the historically black college West Virginia State. At the age of 18, she graduated summa cum laude with degrees in mathematics and French.
                <br> <br>
                Johnson initially became one of the first three African American students chosen to integrate the graduate school program at West Virginia University, but dropped out to focus on her family. However, in 1952, she was informed of an opportunity to work at NACA (now known as NASA) as a mathematician. She was hired in 1953 and, once she was given an opportunity to utilize her immense knowledge and talents in mathematics, was relied upon for double checking complex calculations that were once done solely by a computer or by men.

          <h1>Career</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Suddenly, things got hot. The Soviet’s launched their satellite, Sputnik, in 1957, and the United States kicked into high gear in retaliation. Katherine Johnson was pivotal in our early successes in space, including doing trajectory analysis for Alan Shepard’s May 1961 mission, Freedom 7. Additionally, she was the first woman from the Flight Research Division to receive credit in a research report; previously, contributions made by women were barely noted or outright ignored. 
                <br> <br>
                Her most famous achievement is the on-the-fly calculations made during John Glenn’s orbital mission. Although the computers were programmed with the calculations from launch to landing, Katherine Johnson’s skills were called upon to soothe John Glenn’s nervousness over the flight. The computers were prone to stalling and skipping calculations - and Glenn knew that he could rely on Johnson to recheck the numbers. Due to her fast work, the United States was able to turn the Space Race around.
