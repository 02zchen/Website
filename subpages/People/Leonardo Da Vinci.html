          <h1>About</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Leonardo da Vinci’s parents, Ser Piero and Caterina, were never married. Caterina left and married another man, while da Vinci was still very young, to start a new family. At the age of 5, da Vinci moved into his father’s estate i n Vinci. Da Vinci’s uncle also helped raise the young boy and had an interest in nature, which da Vinci also developed as he grew older. Da Vinci did not receive a formal education aside from basic reading, writing, and math. However, he had a natural artistic talent, which his father greatly appreciated. As a result, Ser Piero had da Vinci get apprenticed by Andrea del Verrocchio, a noted sculptor and painter from Florence, at the age of 15. For the next decade, da Vinci developed his painting, sculpting, and mechanical techniques.</h5>

          <h1>Career</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Around 1482, Leonardo da Vinci began painting his first commissioned art piece, The Adoration of the Magi. However, da Vinci never completed the piece because he relocated to Milan to serve as an engineer, painter, architect, designer, and sculptor for the Sforza clan. He was tasked with creating a 16-foot-tall bronze statue in commemoration of the dynasty’s founder, Francesco Sforza. The clay model of the sculpture was completed 12 years later, however, the bronze had been repurposed for cannons in an imminent war and the clay model was destroyed during the conflict when the Sforza family fled. The majority of da Vinci’s paintings and sculptures have not survived to this day. However, of the few that remain, two are very well-known throughout the world. The first is “The Last Supper,” which he painted during his time in Milan. When Milan was invaded by the French and the Sforza clan fled, da Vinci escaped to Venice and Florence, where he painted a series of portraits. The most prominent of these portraits was called “La Gioconda,” known today as the “Mona Lisa.” Today, the “Mona Lisa” is the only one of da Vinci’s portraits that survives.</h5>

          <h1>Achievements and Awards</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Leonardo da Vinci is known for his designs, art, cartography, geology, and other personal studies. His designs visualized and were essential to various inventions such as the tank, parachute, helicopter, mechanical robot, diving suit, and many more. His studies also helped map out the human anatomy in vivid detail. Further, he is renowned around the world as one of the greatest painters of all time.

          <h1>Connection to DreamPort</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">When military officers want to prototype and develop new ideas, there are lengthy approval processes that can take years to complete. Although these processes serve an important purpose, it is more efficient to prototype the idea in a faster time frame without having to wait years for approval. Dreamport takes these ideas and prototypes solutions and products for the task or purpose specified. Similarly, Leonardo da Vinci had several ideas for inventions and not only designed them in great detail in his notes, but also built physical prototypes of his ideas (such as the fridge, tank, mechanical soldier, etc).</h5>
