          <h1>About</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Born in Boston, Massachusetts on January 17, 1706, Benjamin Franklin was one of 10children born to Josiah Franklin and Abiah Folger.  At the age of 10, Franklin left school to workfor his father.  At the age of 12, he became an apprentice to his brother in the printing trade.  Atthe age of 15, he and his brother had created the first truly independent paper in the Colonies,The New-England Courant.  With this new paper, Franklin posed his views through a made-upcharacter, Mrs. Dogood, a middle-aged widow.  Franklin then left his apprenticeship without his brother’s consent and ran away to Philadelphia.</h5>

          <h1>Life</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In Philadelphia, Franklin created Junto, which brings together aspiring artisans and
              tradesmen to better themselves and the community. After members donated books to read,
              they soon realized that relying solely on donations was not good enough. Here, Franklin
              developed the idea of a library subscription, where members pooled money and bought books
              for everyone to share. This lead to the creation of the Library Company of Philadelphia. After
              the death of his former employer, he returned to his original trade of Printing. He created two
              more papers, The Pennsylvania Gazette and the Die Philadelphische Zeitung (a German
              newspaper). Successful ideas such as Junto, subscriptions, and his book “Poor Richard’s
              Almanack” led to Benjamin Franklin becoming a renowned person in Pennsylvania.

          <h1>Works</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In 1746, Franklin began exploring the concept of electricity. He constructed a capacitor
              out of glass and lead, which he used to demonstrate the principle of Conservation of Charge.
              These findings led to him earning multiple awards, including the Royal Society's Copley Medal,
              degrees from both Harvard and Yale, and the unit of electric charge being named after him, the
              franklin. His findings led to his famous kite experiment, where Franklin extracted sparks from
              the clouds, proving that lightning is electrical.
              <br> </br>He also worked in many other fields, including oceanography, meteorology, and
              refrigeration.
              <br> </br>After his scientific works, Franklin began to work with the government. He drafted the
              Declaration of Independence with four others. He soon became an ambassador to France for
              the United States. After coming back from France, he became president of the Pennsylvania
              Abolition Society, eventually becoming the President of Pennsylvania. Because of his popular
              and meaningful works, Franklin can now be found almost everywhere in modern society,
              between US Postage, exhibits, awards, and the $100 bill.</h5>
