          <h1>About</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Marie Curie was born in Warsaw, Poland. At the age of 16, she graduated with a gold medal from the Russian lycée. Marie’s father, a mathematics and physics teacher, lost his savings due to a bad investment, so Marie became a teacher and governess in order to earn money. She also enrolled in the “floating university” of Poland which secretly educated the Polish youth. She mainly did this as an act of defiance to the barriers women faced in pursuing a higher education. At age 18, Marie left Poland and went to Paris, France with her sister. She helped pay her sister’s finances for medical school, in agreement that her sister would help her get an education. She later studied at the Sorbonne (a prestigious university in Paris), and surviving off of mere bread and tea, occasionally fainting due to starvation, she earned a mathematics and physics degree.</h5>

          <h1>Career</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">After graduating from the Sorbonne, Marie Curie did research in Gabriel Lippman’s laboratory (Lippman was Curie’s professor in Sorbonne), and met her husband, Pierre Curie, inthe spring of 1894. After getting married to Pierre, she became intrigued by Henri Becquerel's discovery of radiation coming out of the Uranium isotope. So, the Curies looked into it and discovered that Thorium did the same thing. When examining a super radioactive ore called “Pitchblende”, they discovered two other elements: Polonium and Radium. Marie was able to successfully extract a tenth of a gram of pure radium from several tons of pitchblende. She earned the Nobel prize in physics and chemistry for her discoveries. After her husband’s death, Marie took over Pierre’s teaching position at the Sorbonne -- she was the university’s first female professor. Marie’s work drastically changed medical research and treatments. She opened mobile radiology units during World War I and did research about how radiation affects tumors. She died on July 4th, 1934 due to a bone marrow disease, which many believe was caused due to her excessive exposure to radiation.</h5>

          <h1>Connection to DreamPort</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Marie Curie was a pioneering woman who achieved many milestones in physics and chemistry. She was able to blaze trails that no man or woman has ever been able to do before. Her success and determination set her as an example of women’s capabilities and strengths. DreamPort is a mission accelerator, and one of the most important aspects of driving missions is having a diverse team. Marie and Pierre Curie were able to achieve many milestones in chemistry and physics together, as a diverse couple coming from different backgrounds. This principle of diversity and inclusion is prominent in Dreamport’s stance as a mission accelerator: DreamPort strives to introduce diverse technology companies and products for the government so that revolutionary discoveries and accomplishments can be made, just like Marie Curie did in the sciences.</h5>
