          <h1>About</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Alan Turing was a computer scientist, mathematician, and cryptologist who played pivotal roles in the development of important computer ideologies. Turing helped influence theoretical computer science by formalizing ideologies such as algorithm and computation, and created the Turing machine, seen by many as the first general-purpose computer. He worked at Bletchley Park during World War II for the Government Code and Cypher School, as a code breaker. As a kid, Alan became close with a student named Christopher Morcom, who is believed to have been his first love. Christopher died of bovine tuberculosis in 1930, and Alan responded by working harder in everything that he did. After serving in World War II, Alan was indentified as a homosexual by the British government. He then commited suicide after struggling with the hormonal medications that he was prescribed.</h5>

            <h1>Career</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Turing created what is considered to be the first general-purpose computer, known as the Turing machine. In short, it is a machine that can simulate any and all computer algorithms based on a predefined set of rules. During World War II, Turing was chosen to be one of the main cryptographers stationed at Bletchley Park. It is here where he, along with other cryptographers, worked to crack German WWII Ciphers, called the Enigma. Eventually, it was found that German ciphers changed everyday. Alan sought to build a device that could solve those daily ciphers. His “bombe machine” was used to find some of the daily configuration used in the Enigma machine so that the daily code was easier to crack and the transmissions could be intercepted more often. His cryptological skills can be seen as an early case of cyber security, as he helped to encrypt and decrypt important data, sparking how we protect our data today. After the war, Turing became the reader for the mathematics department in Manchester, where he eventually devised the idea of Artificial Intelligence. (AI). He created the Turing test: a test that could determine whether or not a computer was intelligent. A computer would be deemed intelligent if a human judge could not tell the difference between the computer and another human during a conversation. Turing also expanded the fields of mathematics and computer science through various new forms of thinking. The idea of algorithms and mathematical biology have shaped the way that different fields of science can work as one.</h5>

          <h1>Connection to DreamPort</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">The Turing machine is an example of a CPU, one of the most important parts of any technological device. DreamPort deals with all kinds of technologies, and making sure that they stay secure is another big part of what Turing dealt with. DreamPort works with the government to make sure that all communications sent by the government are secured. The securing of important data and communications is one of DreamPort’s prime focuses. It is also important to try and intercept any hostile communications and decrypt them, which is one of the biggest focuses that Turing had. By analyzing Turing’s analysis on how data and communications can be secured, Dreamport can learn a lot about how their enemies may try and encrypt their data. DreamPort also deals a lot with artificial intelligence and machine learning, another of Turing’s biggest focuses. Turing’s research on artificial intelligence and his own Turing Test can be applied to the AI at DreamPort, as the use AI is becoming more and more important in our expanding digital age. AI allows us to automate and do things faster and more efficiently, and both DreamPort and Alan Turing share a large focus on the uses of AI.</h5>
