          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Mark Dean is a computer scientist and engineer who worked with IBM to develop many
              revolutionary technologies such as the first color PC monitor and the first gigahertz chip. He
              holds three of IBM’s nine patents on crucial computer electronics. One of his most notable
              achievements was the invention of the ISA bus, or Industry Standard Architecture bus.</h5>

          <h1>Early Life</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">He was born on March 2, 1957, in Jefferson City, Tennessee. He attended Jefferson City
              High School, where he was both a straight A student and a talented athlete. He then completed
              his bachelor's degree at University of Tennessee, graduating at the top of his class in 1979. In
              1980, he received a job at IBM, where he quickly excelled. During this time, he was able to
              create many of his notable inventions and obtain many of his patents. He also was able to
              complete his master’s degree at Florida Atlantic University in 1982 and finished his PhD in
              Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 1992.</h5>

          <h1>Achievements and Awards</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">His contributions to the field of computer science during his time at IBM shaped what we
              now call a computer today. For example, he was able to develop the Industry Standard
              Architecture system bus alongside Dennis Moeller, finishing it in 1981. This allowed the
              connection of peripheral processing devices to the central processing unit. Essentially, this
              allowed the usage of devices such as keyboards, disk drives, monitors, and printers alongside a
              computer. He also led the team of IBM engineers that went on to create the first gigahertz chip in
              1999, which was able to do one billion calculations per second. One additional achievement of
              his was his patents on fundamental computer electronics, from which the modern personal
              computer is derived. His patents are on the graphical controllers, device interfaces, and the ISA
              bus.<br> <br>
              He received many awards for his work, cementing and establishing his legacy. In 1996,
              he was named an IBM fellow, making him the first African American to receive such a
              distinction. Then in 1997, he received the Black Engineer of the Year award and was inducted
              into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In 2001, he was selected to be a member of the
              National Academy of Engineers. He is quoted as having said that, “A lot of kids growing up
              today aren’t told that you can be whatever you want to be. There may be obstacles, but there are
              no limits.”</h5>
