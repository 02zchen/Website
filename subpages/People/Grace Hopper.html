          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Grace Hopper was a computer scientist and a US rear admiral. She was
              the reason for many improvements related to technology, which led to her
              success and fame.</h5>

          <h1>Education</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Grace attended the Hartridge School while she attempted to get into the 
            Vassar College before being rejected at age 16. The following year she 
            attempted again and got in. Here she achieved a bachelor's degree in 
            physics and math. Later on she went to Yale University to work for her master's degree and 
            earned a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1934. Hopper started teaching mathematics at Vassar College one 
            year after entering Yale until she joined the Navy in 1943.</h5>

          <h1>Career</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Grace tried to join the Navy during the early stages of World War Two but 
            was denied for a variety of reasons. In 1943 she obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and entered 
            the US Navy Reserve. Grace trained at Smith College and graduated first in her class one year later. 
            After she exited Smith College she was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project in Harvard 
            where she worked on the Mark I computer with Howard Aiken. Later in 1949, Hopper joined the Eckert-Mauchly
            Computer Corporation where she was in team developing the UNIVAC I. This was when Grace started believing
            in the idea of a programming language that used only English words. Three years later the first paper on 
            compilers was made. Her creation of the linker lead to the beginning of COBOL, which is still the biggest business language.</h5>

          <h1>Legacy</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Grace Hopper had a multitude of achievements including creating the first
              linker leading to the creation of COBOL, becoming a rear admiral in the US
              Navy, and being on the development team of the Mark I and UNIVAC I
              computers. The relation that Grace Hopper has to DreamPort is quite deep.
              She created linkers and helped in the creation of more English based
              programming languages which helps thousands if not millions of people
              including the ones in DreamPort to write code faster and more precise.
              Grace also helped in the development of early computers by being on the
              Mark I and UNIVAC I teams which helped computers in general get better.</h5>
