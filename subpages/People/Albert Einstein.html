          <h1>About</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Albert Einstein was born in Germany in the year 1879. His parents were both Jewish and Einstein
              originally was as well. Einstein began to read books on science which in turn contradicted his religious
              beliefs. Einstein slowly became more and more infatuated with the scientific world. Einstein went on to
              develop his theories of relativity and won a Nobel Prize in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric
              effect.</h5>

          <h1>Early Life</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Einstein had one sister, Maria, alongside with his father Hermann Einstein and mother Pauline
              Koch. There were two main components to Einstein’s fascination with science. The first was the compass
              which he first saw at age 5. This began his fascination with invisible forces. The second was a geometry
              book he had gotten at age 12. Einstein had a friend, Max Talmud, that also helped to tutor Einstein and
              introduce him to new mathematical and philosophical books and ideologies. At age 16, Einstein’s father’s
              company began to fail. Hermann and Pauline moved towards Zurich and left Einstein in a boarding house
              in Munich to finish his education. With pressure growing on Einstein to join the military, Einstein ran
              away to his parents house. Einstein’s future looked bleak, however, he was allowed into a college if he
              passed the entrance exams. Einstein failed 3 categories but his math and physics scores were exceptional.
              The college agreed to let him in as long as he finished his formal schooling.</h5>

          <h1>Career</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">After college, Einstein saw a low point in his life. He was unable to find a job to support his
              family and his father’s company had fallen. Einstein tried to make money through tutoring but was fired
              soon after. Einstein finally got a job through a friend who had recommended him for a position as a clerk.
              Shortly afterwards, Einstein’s father became ill and passed away. 
              <br> <br>In 1903, Einstein married Maric with his slowly steadying income and began to start researching
              into science again. In 1905, Einstein published 4 papers, in which he shook the world of modern physics.
              In the papers, Einstein applied quantum physics to explain the photoelectric effect, calculated the size of
              juggling atoms in Avogrado’s law, established his theory of special relativity, and provided the first
              mechanism to explain the sun and stars energy source. 1905 was considered Einstein’s ‘golden year’.</h5>

          <h1>Connection to DreamPort</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">The main relation between Einstein and DreamPort is the stride to innovate and create new
              things. At DreamPort, creativity is encouraged alongside new solutions to replace the old. Einstein
              decided to go against his religious beliefs and scientific learning in which he became a renowned
              physicist and mathematician. Einstein delved into new areas and used his newfound knowledge to
              discover new things while also continuing learning. Dreamport also encourages both employees and interns to find new ways to solve the presented problems efficiently. If that breaks the common ideology
              then so be it.</h5>
