          <h1>About</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Augusta Ada Byron, better known as Ada Lovelace, was born in London on December 10, 1815,
              and was the daughter of famed poet, Lord George Gordon Byron. Due to an unhappy marriage, Lady
              Byron separated from her husband just weeks after their daughter Ada was born and was brought up by
              her mother. Lady Byron wished for her daughter to be unlike her father, so at her mother’s insistence,
              Ada was taught mathematics and science by her tutors since her mother had mathematical training
              herself. Courses such as these were not typically taught to women at this time as they were thought to
              be too challenging, but her mother believed that challenging her with rigorous education would prevent
              Ada from developing traits similar to her father.
              Ada displayed a strong talent for numbers, engineering, and language early on, producing a
              design for a flying machine at just the age of 5. Due to her talent, she had the opportunity to receive
              instruction from notable professionals, such as Mary Somerville, a Scottish astronomer and
              mathematician.

            <h1>Inventing</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32">In 1833 at the age of 17, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, a professor of mathematics at
                Cambridge and at the time was known as the inventor of the Difference Engine, an elaborate calculating
                machine. Ada was captivated by Babbage’s inventions and due to her fascination with machines, the
                two began an extensive correspondence about mathematics and logic and would become lifelong
                friends.
                In 1834, Babbage made plans for a new type of calculating machine, called the Analytical Engine.
                In 1842, Italian mathematician Louis Menebrea published a French memoir on the machine and
                Babbage enlisted the help of Lovelace to translate the work. Between 1842 and 1843, Lovelace worked
                tirelessly on not only the translation of the memoir, but the set of notes that she appended to it as well.
                These notes are the original source of her fame and her earliest major contribution to the field of
                computing. Lovelace understood the plans for the device as well as Babbage, but she also understood
                the true promise of it. Rather than just being a computation machine, she saw it as what we know today
                as a general-purpose computer. This, combined with the notes about the memoir and how she
                theorized about interacting with machines using a new language, is why she is considered to be the very
                first computer programmer.
