          <h1>Early Life</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">  Augusta Ada Byron, better known as Ada Lovelace, was born in London on December 10, 1815,
              and was the daughter of famed poet, Lord George Gordon Byron. Due to an unhappy marriage, Lady
              Byron separated from her husband just weeks after their daughter Ada was born and was brought up by
              her mother. Lady Byron wished for her daughter to be unlike her father, so at her mother’s insistence,
              Ada was taught mathematics and science by her tutors since her mother had mathematical training
              herself. Courses such as these were not typically taught to women at this time as they were thought to
              be too challenging, but her mother believed that challenging her with rigorous education would prevent
              Ada from developing traits similar to her father.
              <br> <br>Ada displayed a strong talent for numbers, engineering, and language early on, producing a
              design for a flying machine at just the age of 5. Due to her talent, she had the opportunity to receive
              instruction from notable professionals, such as Mary Somerville, a Scottish astronomer and
              mathematician.

          <h1>Work</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">In 1833 at the age of 17, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, a professor of mathematics at
            Cambridge and at the time was known as the inventor of the Difference Engine, an elaborate calculating
            machine. Ada was captivated by Babbage’s inventions and due to her fascination with machines, the
            two began an extensive correspondence about mathematics and logic and would become lifelong
            friends.
            <br> <br>In 1834, Babbage made plans for a new type of calculating machine, called the Analytical Engine.
            In 1842, Italian mathematician Louis Menebrea published a French memoir on the machine and
            Babbage enlisted the help of Lovelace to translate the work. Between 1842 and 1843, Lovelace worked
            tirelessly on not only the translation of the memoir, but the set of notes that she appended to it as well.
            These notes are the original source of her fame and her earliest major contribution to the field of
            computing. Lovelace understood the plans for the device as well as Babbage, but she also understood
            the true promise of it. Rather than just being a computation machine, she saw it as what we know today
            as a general-purpose computer. This, combined with the notes about the memoir and how she
            theorized about interacting with machines using a new language, is why she is considered to be the very
            first computer programmer. </h5>

            <h1>Legacy</h1>
            <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Although she died in November 1852 at the age of 37, Ada Lovelace was a visionary of her time
              and made many contributions to the field of engineering and mathematics that continue to impact society today. She has 
              a long-lasting legacy due to the importance of her work. One of the first programming languages, Ada, was named after 
              her, as well as the second Tuesday in October every year is known as Ada Lovelace Day, on which the contributions of 
              women to the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math are celebrated.

              Dreamport honors Ada Lovelace not only 
              for her contributions to society, but also for their shared goals. Ada tried to push the boundaries by helping to invent 
              the most advanced technology of her time. Similarly, Dreamport strives to create new, cutting edge technology that will 
              benefit society. Both Ada and Dreamport are founders in their fields due to their shared passion for innovation and technology.
