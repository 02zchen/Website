          <h1>About</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Walt Disney was a contributor and pioneer in the field on hand-drawn animation in the
              early to mid-twentieth-century. He began by working with his partner Ub Iwerks to start a small
              animation and film studio, mainly focusing on advertising and short films. After some setbacks
              and failures Walt Disney started what is arguably the most widely recognized and successful
              animation studio.</h5>

          <h1>Early Life</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Walt Disney was born in 1901, in Illinois. Disney lied about his age 
            to join the Red Cross during World War I at the age of sixteen. Upon returning home, Disney 
            started on his path through the world of animation by attending Kansas City Art Institute, 
            where he would meet his future business partner, Ub Iwerks.
            <br> <br>Disney and Iwerks started their business careers by opening a small company, which
              focused on short animated films. They were more common than animated movies because they
              took less time and were almost non-existent before Disney revolutionized the world of
              animation with his later feature-film length animations. Disney and Iwerks, however, went
              bankrupt shortly after beginning their company. Disney persisted in his efforts, and despite a
              man named Charles Mintz and his wife M.J. Winkler stealing his intellectual properties and
              animators, Disney continued his career in animation with Iwerks. He came up with the idea for a
              character named Mickey Mouse on a train, and his cartoon Steamboat Willie cemented him as
              an acclaimed animator.</h5>

          <h1>Career</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Walt Disney’s studio was one of the most innovative of its time. First of all, he created
              the first color cartoon in 1932, which also happened to be the first cartoon to win an Oscar. His
              innovation continued, with the release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, which was
              the first feature film length animation. His innovation revolutionized animation and cemented it
              as a style of movie on par with live action, which helped create the volume of animated films we
              see in theaters today. The 1940s and 1950s brought more success for Disney’s studio, with
              releases like Cinderella and Peter Pan. Disney even opened a theme park called Disneyland in
              1955. Disneyworld would open in 1971, five years after his death.</h5>

          <h1>Connection to DreamPort</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">DreamPort seeks to innovate and revolutionize the fields of technology and cyberspace,
              just like Disney changed the way the world saw animation. His world-changing contributions
              mirror the goals of DreamPort. Animation also has a relationship to technology, as technological
              development fuels innovation in animation style and efficiency. This intertwined relationship
              demonstrates how Walt Disney helped innovate in fields parallel to DreamPort. Overall,
              innovation is the primary goal of DreamPort, and one of the central focuses of Disney’s life was
              innovation in every sector in which he worked.</h5>
