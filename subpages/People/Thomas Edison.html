          <h1>About</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Thomas Edison was born in Milan, Ohio and grew up in Port Huron, Michigan, and was schooled by his mother for most of his childhood. He learned mainly from books, notably R.G. Parker's School of Natural Philosophy, and from classes at The Cooper Union. Edison suffered hearing problems throughout his life, which developed due to scarlet fever during childhood and untreated ear infections. After his family moved to Port Huron, he worked on the railroad selling candy, newspapers, and vegetables.</h5>

          <h1>Career</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Edison became a telegraph operator on the railroads in the area and studied math and chemistry during his spare time. He began to print a paper, the Grand Trunk Herald, that spurred his entrepreneurial spirit. Continuing his passion for experimentation, he founded a company with Franklin Leonard Pope, where they invented a multiplex telegraph, which allowed commercial operators to send multiple messages over the same wire at the same time, greatly improving transmission rates. With funds from the multiplex telegraph, Edison established the Menlo Park lab, where he and his staff worked to advance technology. Edison is credited with many of its accomplishments; however it is important to note that many of them would not have been possible without the knowledge and efforts of those who worked with him. One major invention at Menlo Park was the phonograph, a device inspired by Alexander Graham Bell’s telephone, which recorded an audio signal onto a cylinder. Edison patented the device, though it was later improved by Bell and others. Edison is also known for creating a viable incandescent lightbulb and used this invention to market his electric utility. Edison championed Direct Current (DC), and quickly entered into the “War of Currents”, with Nikola Tesla championing Alternating Current (AC). The argument for DC was based around the dangers of high voltage AC with Edison performing marketing stunts, such as using an electric chair with AC to execute a man and killing animals using AC. Edison is also known for inventing the kinetograph, and eventually founding a film studio which produced over a thousand films. However, his monopolistic practices and use of patent law to force other filmmakers out of the market lead to them fleeing to Los Angeles and producing unlicensed films, a movement that eventually grew into Hollywood.</h5>

Our modern life would not be the same without Edison and those who worked under him. His advancements in lighting made electricity viable, and without that we wouldn’t even have computers and cybersecurity. It’s clear that Edison is responsible for major parts of modern society.</h5>
