          <h1>About</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Galileo Galilei was born on February 15, 1564, in Pisa, Italy. Many consider Galileo the father of
              modern science, as he made huge contributions to the fields of philosophy, mathematics,
              cosmology, astronomy, and physics.</h5>

          <h1>Early Life</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">He was born the first of the six children of Vincenzo Galilei, a famous musician and a
              scholar. During his childhood, Galileo was heavily influenced by his pious father and pursued
              the path of priesthood. However, as a result of his father’s urges, Galileo ended up enrolling at
              the University of Pisa to study medicine instead. Medicine was not his cup of tea and he soon
              side-tracked and discovered a love for the sciences. In 1583, he made his first large discovery;
              he created a ruleset that governed the motion of pendulums. His career advanced further and
              he became the chair of mathematics at the University of Pisa and Padua from 1589 to 1610.

          <h1>Achievements</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">As a polymath, Galileo had major accomplishments in the fields of engineering,
              astronomy, physics, and mathematics. As an engineer, his most commonly known “invention” is
              his modification of the telescope (Hans Lippershey invented the first telescope) in 1610. The
              new-and-improved telescope allowed Galileo to observe the universe on a level unbeknownst
              to human kind at the time. In the January of 1610, Galileo discovered four “stars” (the four
              largest moons of Jupiter) orbiting around Jupiter. He published a short treatise titled “Siderius
              Nuncius” describing his observations of the moons. His later works included observations of
              Venus, sun spots, and most of the more noticeable stars in the Milky Way. In the field of
              physics, Galileo was also accredited as being the first to understand the fundamentals of
              frequency. He discovered that pitch was directly correlated with the spacing between each
              chisel skip as he dragged a chisel across a rock at various speeds. His contributions to
              mathematics included a theory named Galileo’s Paradox, which despite being no longer viable, 
              was important in the fact that it provided a way to understand the relationship between
              transfinite numbers (he stated that they could not be compared).</h5>

          <h1>Connection to DreamPort</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Galileo is one of the historic embodiments of innovation; he developed new theories
              and challenged previous conceptions regardless of who he was offending and who doubted
              him, whether it be the church or Aristotle. His consistent advocacy for a heliocentric universe
              eventually lead to the church placing him under house arrest for the rest of his life in 1630. This
              kind of thinking and drive reflects one of the core principles behind the work done at MISI and
              Dreamport.</h5>
