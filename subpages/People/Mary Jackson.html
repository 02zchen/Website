          <h1>Early Life</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Mary Winston Jackson was born on April 9th, 1921, in Hampton, Virginia. She graduated from
              high school with highest honors and went on to attend Hampton Institute, from which she graduated
              with a dual degree in physical sciences and mathematics in 1942. Her path to NASA was not direct. She
              held several other jobs after her graduation, including being a math teacher in a Maryland high school, a
              bookkeeper at the National Catholic Community Center in Hampton, and a receptionist and clerk at
              Hampton Institute’s Health Department. In 1944, she married Levi Jackson, a sailor in the Navy, and had
              two children: Levi Jackson, Jr. And Carolyn Marie Lewis. Finally, in 1951, she was hired by the National
              Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, later changed to the National Aeronautics and Space
              Administration, or NASA).</h5>

          <h1>Early Career</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Jackson worked in the West Area Computing unit of the Langley Memorial Aeronautical
              Laboratory (later NASA Langley Research Facility), a segregated unit for female African American
              mathematicians. In 1953, Jackson began working for engineer Kazimierz Czarnecki conducting
              experiments in the Supersonic Pressure Tunnel. Jackson gained a lot of hands-on experience from her
              time working for Czarnecki, and he eventually suggested that she enter a training program to become an
              engineer herself. Participants in the course had to take graduate-level classes in math and physics taught
              at Hampton High School. Since the school was segregated, Jackson had to request special permission
              from the City of Hampton to join the class. Undeterred by the obstacle, she completed the courses and
              became NASA’s first female African American engineer in 1958.

          <h1>Late Career</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Jackson worked as an engineer at NASA for approximately 20 years, focusing on the boundary
              layer of air around airplanes. She became frustrated by her slowing promotions and inability to break
              into management. Realizing that the same was true for the other women at NASA, she took a demotion
              in 1979 to fill the open position of Langley’s Federal Women’s Program Manager. In that position, she
              worked to improve opportunities for women at the organization. She retired in 1985 after a long and
              successful career. Her career was not the only way she helped her community. She served as a Girl
              Scout troop leader for over thirty years, and in the 70s, she assisted children in the science club at
              Hampton’s King Street Community Center in building a wind tunnel to conduct experiments. Mary
              Jackson passed away on February 11, 2005. Her tireless work to break boundaries and uplift women in
              STEM will never cease to inspire the world.

          <h1>Connection to DreamPort</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">It is fitting that Dreamport name a room after Mary Jackson, since they represent similar ideals.
              Mary Jackson’s work with the Girl Scouts and the community center in her neighborhood exemplifies
              her dedication to the betterment of her community, more specifically the children in her community.
              Dreamport demonstrates that same dedication through the opening of their internship program. By
              taking on high school interns and allowing them to explore their interest in STEM, Dreamport is
              providing the same learning environment that Jackson provided to the children in the community
              center.</h5>
