          <h1>About</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643 in England. His father died three months before he was born prematurely. Newton was educated at “The King’s School” in Grantham, where he learned Latin and Greek, which had a huge impact on Newton as he pursued further mathematics. In June 1661, Newton was accepted to Trinity College, Cambridge, and he was awarded a scholarship to the program in 1664. After four more years of college, Newton got his Master’s Degree and began to develop mathematical theories that he would later call “calculus”. In 1665, he discovered the binomial theorem and obtained his BA degree in August of 1665. Newton privately studied many things at his home including his ideas on calculus, optics and the law of gravitation. Newton’s studies impressed the famous professor Isaac Barrow, who Newton later succeeded after receiving his master’s degree. Newton was also elected a “Fellow of the Royal Society” in 1672.</h5>

          <h1>Career</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Isaac Newton was a physicist and a mathematician who is highly acclaimed in many different subjects. In 1687, Isaac Newton published his most important work, “Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy). Newton discovered many things in the fields of optics, motion, and mathematics. Newton’s first major point in his career was building a reflecting telescope in 1668. He later published his notes in optics and light in his book “Opticks: Or, A treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections and Colours of Light.” According to a myth, between 1665 and 1667, Newton was sitting under a tree and an apple fell, making him think about the concept of gravity. Later on, Newton published his three basic laws of motion, as well as his theory about gravitational attraction.</h5>

          <h1>Achievements and Awards</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Isaac Newton created the three laws of motion that we know today (and learn in physics classes). He also created the notion that gravity is a universal force instead of a unique one. His law of universal gravitation states that two bodies in the universe will always attract each other in a way that is proportional to their masses and the square of the distance between the two bodies. Newton also wrote a book called “Principia Mathematica”, which is one of the most essential scientific works in history. Newton also explained Kepler’s laws, as well as discovering the binomial theorem in 1665. Isaac Newton is also credited with inventing calculus, as well as the first reflecting telescope.</h5>

          <h1>Connection to DreamPort</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Isaac Newton was a man of innovation and dedication, and many of his philosophies about life were present in the developers of Dreamport. Isaac Newton was persistent and creative, and these attributes were also key character traits of the creators of Dreamport, who were clearly very creative and had powerful ideas in order to create such a unique company.
