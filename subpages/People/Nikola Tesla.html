          <h1>About</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Austrian Empire. Tesla lived the majority of his early life without leaving the Austrian Empire. During which he received advanced education in physics and engineering in the 1870s. Then going on to work in telephony and at Continental Edison. In 1884 he immigrated to the U.S. working shortly under Edison once again before separating out, on his own,  allowing him to develop his alternating current induction motor and his polyphase AC patents, After making a considerable profit from licensing his inventions, he decided to continue down this path, conducting a wide range of experiments with mechanical oscillators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He even created a wireless controlled boat. All to further his goal of creating wireless power for the whole world.</h5>

          <h1>Career</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Tesla’s career “officially” started in 1881 when he went to work at the Budapest telephone exchange, where he began working in electrical engineering, improving the repeaters and amplifier structure of the exchange. Quickly moving on in the next year to work for Edison’s brand-new industry by distributing power thought the city in order to install incandescent light bulbs. His next career step was to move to the U.S. Working still for Edison briefly. Then he decided to branch out on his own, with the support of his partners he founded a series of labs all over New York. In doing this he forced himself down an entrepreneurial path. This allowed him to develop his AC induction motor and polyphase AC patents. After earning most of his income off of the licensing, he continued to develop his ideas and his research. He first developed his “Tesla Coil” then working on his wireless lighting ideas and early x-ray tubes.</h5>

This concept of the maker space is very similar if not the same as Tesla's series of labs he started. These labs enabled Tesla to accomplish everything he could in a "maker space" to develop his ideas into actual products.</h5>
