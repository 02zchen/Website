          <h1>About</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">George Carruthers is an African American inventor, physicist, and astronautical engineer
              known for his invention of the Far Ultraviolet Electrographic Camera. He was awarded a patent
              for his “Image Converter for Detecting Electromagnetic Radiation Especially in Short Wave
              Lengths” in 1969, and in 1970 his UV telescope and image converter were used to prove the
              existence of molecular hydrogen in space. They were also used on the Apollo 16 mission in
              1972.</h5>

          <h1>Early Life</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">George Carruthers was born on October 1, 1939, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Due to his love for
              science, he constructed his own telescope from cardboard tubing and lenses ordered through the
              mail when he was 10 years old. Although his father died when he was 12, he continued to pursue
              his interest in science. His love for science would lead him to study Physics and Nuclear
              Engineering at the University of Illinois in 1957. He received a BS and MS in Physics in 1961
              and 1962 respectively and earned a PhD in Aeronautical and Astronomical Engineering in 1964.</h5>

          <h1>Career</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">After receiving his PhD, Carruthers went to work at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory
              as a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow. While there, he became a full-time
              researcher at the E. O. Hurlburt Center for Space Research and was awarded a patent for his UV
              telescope and image converter. His Far Ultraviolet Electrographic Camera was used in the
              Apollo 16 mission in 1972, where it was used to examine both Earth’s atmosphere and other
              stars and galaxies. His invention would continue to be used on future space missions.
              <br> <br>Throughout his career, George Carruthers received many awards for his work. He was
              awarded NASA’s Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal for his work with the Apollo 16
              mission. He was also named Black Engineer of the Year in 1987. He received the 2012 National
              Medal of Technology and Innovation from President Obama at the White House. Carruthers
              continues to promote science and technology among young students, focusing especially on
              African American students.</h5>
