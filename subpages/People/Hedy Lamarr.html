          <h1>About</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">Born as Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler on November 9, 1914 in 
            Vienna, Austria, Hedy Lamarr was a popular actress known for her beauty who starred
            in many successful films. She was also an inventor in her spare time, although few 
            people in her day knew about this. Her most important invention was spread spectrum 
            technology, which laid the foundation for modern wireless communications.</h5>

          <h1>Early Life</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">As a child, Lamarr showed an early interest in acting, and 
            first appeared in the film Money on the Street (1930) as an extra. At 18, Lamarr 
            starred in the controversial German film Ecstasy (1933), which gave her international 
            fame. She was married in 1933 to Friedrich Mandl, a rich weapons manufacturer with ties 
            to Nazi Germany who forbade Lamarr from appearing in films. A few years later, Lamarr 
            left him and moved to London, where she met Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM. Lamarr impressed
            him enough to get a $500 a week contract and moved to Hollywood in 1938. Based on the
            advice of Mayer, she changed her name from Hedwig Kiesler to Hedy Lamarr to distance herself 
            from the reputation she had as “the Ecstasy Lady”.</h5>

          <h1>Inventing</h1>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="line-height: 35px">During her Hollywood career, Lamarr often portrayed a beautiful, exotic
            woman in films, many of which were very successful. However, these simple roles bored her, so 
            she worked on her hobby: inventing. Some of the various ideas she came up with were streamlining 
            racing airplanes, improving traffic lights, and creating a new carbonated drink. Lamarr’s greatest 
            invention was a radio signaling device she invented with help from her friend George Antheil. It 
            could change frequencies to avoid tracking and jamming and was intended for use by the Navy on 
            radio-controlled torpedoes during World War II. Patented in 1942, it wasn’t adopted until 1962 
            during the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was not until the 1990s that Lamarr started to be recognized 
            for her work, receiving two awards in 1997 for her contribution to the backbone of wireless communications. 
            She passed away January 19, 2000 and was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.</h5>
