            <h5 class="w3-padding-48" style="line-height: 35px">If you were to think about something that you need and use every single day, your first thought would likely be your smartphone. 
              The number of people with smartphones has only been increasing by the year. On each of our smartphones, we have applications that we use on a daily basis to help us 
              with daily tasks or entertainment, however, what are the dangers of these applications that we take for granted? To start with, mobile app security is the extent that 
              mobile apps can protect you from malware and hackers. Criminals can target well known companies and hack their applications in order to leak malware into consumer’s 
              devices. These criminals can also steal sensitive information suchas credit card details and other credentials. Almost half of mobile application developers do not 
              include any type of security from hackers and 95% of all applications are vulnerable in some critical fashion. To help protect yourself from malicious intent, steps 
              need to be taken by yourself to secure your information. One way to help protect yourself from having malware infecting your device are by only downloading from trusted 
              sources. This will help ensure that no third party applications are sending malware into your phone and/or stealing your sensitive information. Another measure that you 
              can take is to not save your password in any applications. Having your credentials stored can make it easier for hackers to hack into multiple of your accounts. 
              Investing in mobile app security services from trusted developers can also help you stay secure as they can monitor and defend from attacks for you as well.</h5>

              <h5 class="w3-padding-48" style="line-height: 35px">Nowadays, many mobile apps are completely insecure. The Javascript that is used to make many apps that make the user experience better often are vulnerable. A variety of threats can damage the livelihoods of both the users and businesses that rely on these apps. The risks that can affect these individuals range from financial fraud to stealing intellectual property.

                Apps that directly communicate with the customers are very important and valuable because this allows the customers to have direct contact with whatever they are trying to buy. However, these apps are also easily exploited through techniques such as reverse engineering. Apps that are still vulnerable and not protected against reverse engineering can be exploited by people who can then garner an understanding of how the app’s code works. This allows the APIs to be compromised and exposes valuable communication keys.
                
                Some ways to secure your mobile apps include writing secure codes without damaging bugs, encrypting all data that goes in or out, and being extra cautious with libraries. Some libraries may have some malicious code that may negatively affect the users. Also, make sure that only authorized APIs are used. High-level authentication is also extremely important, and multi-factor authentication is highly recommended.</h5>
