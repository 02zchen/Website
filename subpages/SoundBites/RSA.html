            <h5 class="w3-padding-48" style="line-height: 35px">RSA, named after the designers Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, is a public-key cryptosystem that is very widely used. A 
              public-key cryptosystem is a system where there is a public encryption key that is available to everyone, and there is a secret private decryption key. RSA is 
              based on the difficulty that comes from factoring the product of two prime numbers.The RSA algorithm consists of four steps: key generation, key distribution, 
              encryption, and decryption. The first step, key generation, consists of choosing two, large prime numbers and computing the values to be used to find the public 
              and private keys. The second step, key distribution, consists of distributing the public and private keys. The public keys are the product of the two large prime 
              numbers and a coprime integer value that is between 1 and the value of Carmichael’s totient function for the first public key. The private key is the modular 
              multiplicative inverse of the coprime integer modulo the value of Carmichael’s totient function for the product of the two prime numbers. In simpler terms, you will 
              only share two values that were found in key generation, and you will keep one value secret. The third step, encryption, involves converting a message to an integer 
              according to the padding scheme, an agreed-upon reversible protocol. With this integer, the plaintext, one uses the public keys as parameters for modular exponentiation 
              to generate the ciphertext. The fourth step, decryption, involves using the ciphertext as well as the public and private keys to reverse the encryption process based on 
              modular congruency. Once the necessary calculations are done, the ciphertext will be converted to plaintext, and the padding scheme can be reversed to get the original 
              message. RSA is important today because it allows people to securely send messages in a way that is not easily reversed. By depending on the difficulty of factoring the 
              product of two prime numbers as well as the irreversibility of modular exponentiation, one can send critical information with little fear of it being decrypted by 
              unknown malicious parties. RSA encryption and decryption are often too slow to convey large amounts of user data but are instead used to hide codes that can be used 
              for symmetric key encryption.</h5>
