            <h5 class="w3-padding-48" style="line-height: 35px">Passwords are the most well known way of securing your accounts andinformation online, but do you know your passwords might not be up topar? 
              There are many ways to ensure that your passwords are hard to crack into but there are three rules I always keep in my head. Make them complex, inconsistent, and 
              inconspicuous. The first rule refers to making sure you aren’t having a password with only lower case letters, make it long with symbols, numbers, and uppercase letters. 
              The second rule means you don’t want to have your passwords be the same on each account, once someone gets into one of your accounts they can get into all of them if you 
              keep the same password. Lastly, the third rule means don’t make it obvious what it might be, first and last name, username, birthday putting any of that in your password 
              makes it much easier to crack into your accounts. Following these three rules will make your accounts much harder to get into, and your information much safer.</h5>

                <h5 class="w3-padding-48" style="line-height: 35px">Passwords are like the key to a lock; the harder it is to find the key and use the key, the harder it is to unlock the lock and get to what is being locked up. As we get deeper and deeper into the digital age, it is important to make sure that our passwords are secure and hard to hack into. -Some ways that you can help make your accounts more secure with passwords are: -Use a password manager, a password manager is somewhere that assists in generating and storing passwords in an encrypted database, it is accessed with one master password -Make long passwords with around 12-15 characters -Make passwords a nonsense phrase -Make passwords complex - use an uppercase letter, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols -Avoid using obvious personal information in your passwords, this includes birthday, first name, last name, any part of your username, etc. -Do not reuse passwords, only use each password one time -Do not give out your passwords to anyone -Change your passwords regularly

                    Following all of these tips for passwords will help you keep your data more secure and make it a lot harder for hackers to get into your data.</h5>
