            <h5 class="w3-padding-48" style="line-height: 35px">While the Internet has proven to be an integral part of everyday life, it often leaves your information out in the open, available to anyone 
              who is willing to try to access it. One way to increase the security of your confidential information is to use a Virtual Private Network (or VPN). VPNs provide secure 
              remote access to a private network over a public network, masking your IP address and encrypting your connection. VPNs create an encrypted end to end connection between 
              you and the VPN server, allowing for data to travel through the “tunnel”, safe from malicious actors. The VPN server also acts as your IP address, allowing you to spoof 
              your location. This makes tracing you difficult and protects your web activity from prying outsiders. Be careful when choosing a VPN. While the free ones may seem enticing, 
              there is almost always a catch: whether that is ads, using your data, or some other secretive actions. Look through the Terms of Service to ensure that your data isn’t being 
              used by the company. Also, check as to whether the VPN is using the most current protocols (ex. Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol). Your VPN provider may set data limits too, 
              so be sure that what you pay for is the amount you need. Some VPNs may also allow for you to have multiple devices using the VPN and choose the location of the server to use.</h5>

                <h5 class="w3-padding-48" style="line-height: 35px">Using the internet on an unsecured Wi-Fi network can expose your private information and browsing habits. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) provides the user online privacy and anonymity by building a private network using a public internet connection. VPNs mask your IP address and establish secure and encrypted connections, making your actions virtually untraceable and providing greater privacy.

                    VPNs work by creating a “data tunnel” between the local network you are in and an exit node in another location. This allows you to make it seem as though you are in a completely different place (which could be thousands of miles away).
                    
                    VPNs protect your browsing history, IP address, location, device, and web activity. When choosing a VPN, there are several pieces to consider. First, you should read the Terms of Service to make sure your provider isn’t tracking your usage statistics to publish or monetize the data. Second, you should make sure your provider is using the most current protocol (i.e. Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) and check that the data limits set by your provider will be sufficient based on your amount of internet usage. You should also take a look at the locations of the servers, which will decide where you are able to “appear” using the VPN. Finally, you want a VPN that allows you to use it among multiple devices.</h5>
