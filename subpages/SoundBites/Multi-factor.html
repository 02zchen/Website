              is so important in a world controlled by the internet. Cyber-attacks on individuals and businesses has increased more and more every year making 
              everyone even more vulnerable to attacks. The use of solely a password to protect your data is over, and the need of multi-factor authentication is here. 
              Multi-factor authentication is a software's ability to verify someone, it provides an extra layer of protection from attackers. It does this through using 
              three methods of verification; Something you are, something you have, and something you know. There are multiple examples for each type of verification method. 
              Something you are can be any type of biometrics, like a fingerprint or facial ID. Something you have can be anything physical, like a key card or key fob. Lastly 
              Something you know can be anything that you remember yourself, such as a password or pin. Help yourself and protect your data by enabling multi-factor authentication 
              whenever you can. Attackers are getting smarter and stronger, so make sure your data protection methods are too! </h5>

            <h5 class="w3-padding-48" style="line-height: 35px">Everyone has a plethora of online accounts with an equally complex system of passwords, or at least they should.
                Even if you keep super complex 15+ character passwords that differ completely from account to account, you are still susceptible to data loss.
                 Anyone has a chance of guessing or figuring out your passwords. This is why on all possible accounts one should enable multi-factor authentication. 
                 multi-factor authentication is a more complex and far more secure way of accessing your accounts and can most basically be described as something you know, 
                 something you have, something you are. In short, enabling multi-factor authentication gives you a wider range of options to log in to your accounts, from biometrics 
                 to authenticator apps, and all without losing your trusty passwords. Having all three of these levels would even further secure your account to the point where they
                  are almost unhackable. However, you can use any combo of these to secure your accounts creating 2, 3, etc. factor authentication. And It may even make it easier 
                  to access your accounts</h5>
