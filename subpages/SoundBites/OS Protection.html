            <h5 class="w3-padding-48" style="line-height: 35px">During the ‘40s and ‘50s, many computer programs were run by a manual process. That is, people would have to insert the programs 
              (which were actually pieces of cardboard with hole punches in them) into a slot in the computer, and the computer would run each program, one at a time. 
              Programs were also written for tasks that required peripheral devices (which are external devices that connect to a computer, like printers). However, 
              this became complicated when different types of printers were being made, and computer configurations varied. Doing basic tasks like device management, 
              file services, etc became more customized. So, to make things more universal and manageable, operating systems were created. Operating systems connect peripheral 
              hardware devices to the software needed to be run (like the cardboard programs). This way, people no longer had to run around and do the heavy lifting behind the 
              running of a program. All they had to do was insert the program and the operating system took care of the memory allocation, file management, and any other process 
              that was needed. This is great, butwith a new level of computing came a new level of security threats. With operating systems, they are able to bridge software that 
              was running to the hardware that needed to be accessed. Malware is easily able to infect many computers with the same operating systems and take over some parts of 
              their functionality. Some ways to protect against this threat is by limiting the number of accounts made on the server computers and granting users read-only permissions 
              on required documents. A few other ways to increase protection include: denying access to files by default, ensuring users do not have access to shell functions, and 
              using wrapper services, like ip tables.</h5>
